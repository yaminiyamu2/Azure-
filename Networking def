***Networking:
   ----------
         Networking in Azure cloud computing is a critical component that enables communication between Azure resources, on-premises data centers, and the internet. 
It encompasses a variety of services and technologies that facilitate the secure and efficient transfer of data.
1.Virtual Networks (VNets):
  ->Definition: A Virtual Network is a logically isolated section of the Azure cloud where you can define your own IP address range, subnets, route tables, and security settings.
  ->Purpose: VNets allow Azure resources, like Virtual Machines (VMs) and Azure App Services, to communicate securely with each other, as well as with on-premises networks.
  ->Subnets: You can create subnets within a VNet to segment your network for different applications or environments (e.g., production, testing).
2.Network Security Groups (NSGs):
  ->Definition: NSGs are used to control inbound and outbound traffic to network interfaces (NIC), VMs, and subnets.
  ->Rules: They consist of security rules that allow or deny traffic based on source/destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
  ->Use Cases: NSGs help in implementing a least-privilege access model and protecting resources from unauthorized access.
3.Azure VPN Gateway:
  ->Definition: A VPN Gateway allows you to create secure site-to-site connections between your on-premises network and your Azure VNets.
    Types of VPNs:
        Site-to-Site: Connects entire networks to Azure.
        Point-to-Site: Connects individual devices to Azure.
   ->Protocols: Supports various protocols like IKEv2 and OpenVPN for secure connectivity.
4.Azure ExpressRoute:
  ->Definition: ExpressRoute is a service that provides a private connection between your on-premises infrastructure and Azure, bypassing the public internet.
    Benefits:
        Increased security and reliability.
        Lower latency and better performance.
  ->Bandwidth options ranging from 50 Mbps to 10 Gbps.
  ->Use Cases: Ideal for organizations with high throughput requirements and sensitive data.
5.Azure Load Balancer:
   ->Definition: A Layer 4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
      Types:
         Public Load Balancer**: Directs traffic from the internet to Azure resources.
         Internal Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic among VMs within a VNet.
    ->Use Cases: Helps improve application availability and scalability.
6.Azure Application Gateway
   ->Definition: A web traffic load balancer that provides application-level routing and security.
     Features:
         URL-based routing.
         SSL termination.
   ->Web Application Firewall (WAF) for protecting applications from common web vulnerabilities.
   ->Use Cases**: Suitable for web applications that require advanced routing and security features.
7.Azure Traffic Manager:
  ->Definition: A DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic across global Azure regions.
    Routing Methods:
      Priority: Routes traffic to a primary endpoint; fails over to secondary if primary fails.
      Weighted: Distributes traffic based on assigned weights.
      Geographic: Routes users to specific endpoints based on their geographic location.
  ->Use Cases: Enhances the availability and responsiveness of applications by directing users to the nearest or best-performing endpoint.
8.Azure Network Watcher:
  ->Definition: A monitoring and diagnostics tool for Azure networking resources.
    Features:
      Network performance monitoring.
      Connection troubleshooting.
      Log analytics for traffic flow.
  ->Use Cases: Helps network administrators maintain optimal performance and troubleshoot issues.
9.Azure Firewall:
  ->Definition: A managed, cloud-based network security service that protects Azure Virtual Network resources.
    Features:
      Built-in high availability.
      Threat intelligence-based filtering.
      Application and network-level filtering rules.
   ->Use Cases: Provides a comprehensive security solution to manage and monitor network traffic.
10.Azure Bastion:
   ->Definition: A fully managed service that provides secure RDP/SSH connectivity to VMs without exposing them to the public internet.
   ->Benefits: Eliminates the need for a public IP address on the VM and mitigates common vulnerabilities associated with direct exposure.
   ->Use Cases: Enhances security for remote management of Azure resources.
